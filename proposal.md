**Answer:**
Design your fractal

## Project description

Provide a short description of what the app does (< 1000 characters).

**Answer:**
The app allows the user to build your own fractal: a tree (to start with). The idea is to give control to the user over the parameters which define a fractal so he can play around and build its own custom fractal. Potential upgrade would be to make the website an open platform where people draw, submit their 3D drawing and can vote for the best ones.

## MVP

**Answer:**
User should be able to draw a tree fractal.

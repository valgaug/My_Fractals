Outside the Set, all the\n          values of ‘C’ cause the equation to go to infinity, and the colors are\n          proportional to the speed at which they expand.\n          <img src='' alt=''></img>\n          The interesting places in ths fractal are all on the edge. We can zoom\n          in forever, and never find a clear edge. The deeper we explore, the\n          longer the numbers become, and the slower the calculations are.

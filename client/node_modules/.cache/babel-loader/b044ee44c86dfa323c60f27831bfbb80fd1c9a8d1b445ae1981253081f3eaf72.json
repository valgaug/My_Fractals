Outside the Set, all the\n            values of ‘C’ cause the equation to go to infinity, and the colors\n            are proportional to the speed at which they expand.\n            <img src='' alt=''></img>\n            The interesting places in ths fractal are all on the edge. We can\n            zoom in forever, and never find a clear edge. The deeper we explore,\n            the longer the numbers become, and the slower the calculations are.\n            Deep fractal exploration takes patience!\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <h1 className='secondHeading'>\n          <span>Code in Javascript</span>\n        </h1>\n        <h2>\n          <span>Tree</span>\n        </h2>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Doc;\n"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAK,MAAM,OAAO;AACzB,OAAO,aAAa;AACpB,OAAOC,YAAY,MAAM,kCAAkC;AAAC,SAAAC,MAAA,IAAAC,OAAA;AAE5D,SAASC,GAAGA,CAAA,EAAG;EACb,oBACED,OAAA;IAAKE,SAAS,EAAC,KAAK;IAACC,EAAE,EAAC,QAAQ;IAAAC,QAAA,eAC9BJ,OAAA;MAAKE,SAAS,EAAC,OAAO;MAAAE,QAAA,gBACpBJ,OAAA;QAAIE,SAAS,EAAC,cAAc;QAAAE,QAAA,eAC1BJ,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAM;QAAkB;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA;MAAO;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QAC5B,eACLR,OAAA;QAAKE,SAAS,EAAC,MAAM;QAAAE,QAAA,eACnBJ,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QAQH;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA;MAAI;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QACA,eACNR,OAAA;QAAIE,SAAS,EAAC,eAAe;QAAAE,QAAA,eAC3BJ,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAM;QAAe;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA;MAAO;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QACzB,eACLR,OAAA;QAAAI,QAAA,eACEJ,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAM;QAAS;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA;MAAO;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QACnB,eACLR,OAAA;QAAKE,SAAS,EAAC,MAAM;QAAAE,QAAA,eACnBJ,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,GAAG,kZAQD,eAAAJ,OAAA;YAAKS,GAAG,EAAEX,YAAa;YAACY,GAAG,EAAC;UAAE;YAAAL,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,QAAO;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA;MACnC;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QACA,eAENR,OAAA;QAAAI,QAAA,eACEJ,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAM;QAAM;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA;MAAO;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QAChB,eACLR,OAAA;QAAKE,SAAS,EAAC,MAAM;QAAAE,QAAA,eACnBJ,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,GAAG,oZAQD,eAAAJ,OAAA;YAAKS,GAAG,EAAC,EAAE;YAACC,GAAG,EAAC;UAAE;YAAAL,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,QAAO;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA;MACvB;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QACA,eACNR,OAAA;QAAIE,SAAS,EAAC,eAAe;QAAAE,QAAA,eAC3BJ,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAM;QAAiB;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA;MAAO;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QAC3B,eACLR,OAAA;QAAKE,SAAS,EAAC,MAAM;QAAAE,QAAA,eACnBJ,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,GAAG,4QAKD,eAAAJ,OAAA;YAAKS,GAAG,EAAC,EAAE;YAACC,GAAG,EAAC;UAAE;YAAAL,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,QAAO,4TAMzB,eAAAR,OAAA;YAAKS,GAAG,EAAC,EAAE;YAACC,GAAG,EAAC;UAAE;YAAAL,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,QAAO;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA;MACvB;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QACA,eAENR,OAAA;QAAIE,SAAS,EAAC,eAAe;QAAAE,QAAA,eAC3BJ,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAM;QAAkB;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA;MAAO;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QAC5B,eACLR,OAAA;QAAKE,SAAS,EAAC,MAAM;QAAAE,QAAA,eACnBJ,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,GAAG,yTAMD,eAAAJ,OAAA;YAAAI,QAAA,eACEJ,OAAA;cAAAI,QAAA,EAAM;YAAiC;cAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA;UAAO;YAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,QAC3C,65BAcL,eAAAR,OAAA;YAAKS,GAAG,EAAC,EAAE;YAACC,GAAG,EAAC;UAAE;YAAAL,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,QAAO,uPAK3B;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA;MAAI;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QACA,eACNR,OAAA;QAAIE,SAAS,EAAC,eAAe;QAAAE,QAAA,eAC3BJ,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAM;QAAkB;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA;MAAO;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QAC5B,eACLR,OAAA;QAAAI,QAAA,eACEJ,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAM;QAAI;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA;MAAO;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QACd;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA;EACD;IAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;IAAAC,UAAA;IAAAC,YAAA;EAAA,QACF;AAEV;AAACG,EAAA,GAjHQV,GAAG;AAmHZ,eAAeA,GAAG;AAAC,IAAAU,EAAA;AAAAC,YAAA,CAAAD,EAAA"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
